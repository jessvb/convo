            <h2>Experiment Information</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Natural language is the language we use naturally (as contrasted with an artificial language or computer code). This experiment tests the effectiveness of a natural language, voice-first system, and compares it against a natural language, text-based system and a system with both text and voice programming features.

                </li>
                <li>
                    The experiment consists of 1) a few short surveys, 2) several different goals you need to achieve through the three programming systems (voice only, text only, voice and text).
                </li>
                <li>
                    You should expect the experiment to last approximately 2 hours.
                </li>

                    You will be able to see your progress at the bottom of the screen on the following pages.

                <li>
                    You will be able to view examples/hints on a sidebar on the right side of the screen on the following pages.
                </li>
                <li>
                    We are evaluating and comparing the different systems, not your abilities. All results are anonymized.
                </li>
            </ul>


            <h2>How the Experiment Works</h2>
            <!-- <p>Please watch the following experiment tasks video before proceeding.</p>

            <ul>
                <li> For each programming system, you will be provided a goal or task to achieve (for example: "Design a video game character.") You will try to do so within the constraints of the programming system by speaking  or typing natural language. </li>
                
                <li> After you achieve each goal, you will complete a short survey. After you have completed all goals, you will be asked to compare the three systems.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Survey</h2>
            <p>If you agree to participate in this experiment, please proceed to the next page to complete a brief survey.</p>

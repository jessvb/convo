                    Natural language is the language we use naturally (as contrasted with an artificial language or computer code). This experiment tests the effectiveness of a natural language, voice-first system, and compares it against a natural language, text-based system and a system with both text and voice programming features.

                </li>
                <li>
                    The experiment consists of 1) a few short surveys, 2) several different goals you need to achieve through the three programming systems (voice only, text only, voice and text).
                </li>
                <li>
                    You should expect the experiment to last approximately 2 hours.

            <h2>How the Experiment Works</h2>
            <!-- <p>Please watch the following experiment tasks video before proceeding.</p>

                For each programming system, you will be provided a goal or task to achieve (for example: "Design a video game character.") You will try to do so within the constraints of the programming system by speaking  or typing natural language.
                <br><br>
                After you achieve each goal, you will complete a short survey. After you have completed all goals, you will be asked to compare the three systems.

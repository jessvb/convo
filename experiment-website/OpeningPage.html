            <h2>Experiment Information</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Natural language is the regular language we use when we’re talking (as contrasted with computer code). Through this study, we want to see if it’s possible for participants to create a computer program by talking conversationally, in natural language, to a conversational agent. Conversational agents are computer programs like chatbots or smart speakers, like Amazon Alexa or Google Home.
                </li>
                <li>
                    In this experiment, you will test voice-first and text-first conversational agent prototypes. Since they are prototypes, you won’t be able to converse with them in natural language, but will have to say specific phrases. Through this study, we will gain insight into how people might naturally interact with them, and use this information to create an improved, natural language version. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    The experiment consists of:
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            A practice stage, in which you are guided through a brief programming task with the conversational agent. You will complete the same task 3 different ways: through speaking, typing, and speaking/typing (for speaking/typing you can choose how you want to interact). The order in which you complete them will be randomized. After each practice stage, you may play around with the system in a “sandbox mode” to see how it works.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            A novice stage, in which you complete a programming task without guidance. Hints and examples will be shown on the left side of the screen. If you’re absolutely stuck, you can ask the people conducting the experiment for help. You will complete similar tasks three times, interacting with the system through speaking, typing, and speaking/typing (as in the practice mode).
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            If you identify as an advanced programmer, there will be an advanced stage, in which you complete more difficult programming tasks in the same way you completed the novice tasks.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Surveys, in which you will answer questions about your experience with the system, as well as demographics. We want to improve the system as much as possible, so we appreciate any and all feedback you have!
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>
                    You should expect the experiment to last approximately 1-2 hours.
                </li>
                <li>
                    You will be able to see your progress at the bottom of the screen on the following pages.
                </li>
                <li>
                    You will be able to view examples/hints on a sidebar on the left side of the screen on the following pages.
                </li>
                <li>
                    We are evaluating and comparing the different systems (voice-based, text-based, and voice/text-based), not your abilities. All results will be anonymized.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <!-- <p>Please watch the following experiment tasks video before proceeding.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    For each programming system, you will be provided a goal or task to achieve (for example: "Design a video game character.")
                    You will try to do so within the constraints of the programming system by speaking  or typing natural language.
                </li>
                <li>
                    After you achieve each goal, you will complete a short survey.
                    After you have completed all goals, you will be asked to compare the three systems.
                </li>
            </ul>

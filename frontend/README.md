# convercode frontend
The frontend of *convercode* includes a click-and-hold recording button, and an output text box, such that users can talk with the agent and see the current user-program (text box is temporary - for debugging). In future iterations, (when the agent provides sufficient information about the user-program through conversation) we will remove the output text box.

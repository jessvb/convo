        </div>

            <h2>Experiment Information</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Natural language</strong> is the regular language we use when we’re talking (as contrasted
                    with computer code). Through this study, we want to see if it’s possible for participants to create
                    a computer program by talking conversationally, in natural language, to a conversational agent.
                    <strong>Conversational agents</strong> are computer programs like chatbots or smart speakers, like
                    Amazon Alexa or Google Home.
                </li>
                <li>
                    In this experiment, you will test <strong>voice-first</strong> and <strong>text-first</strong>
                    conversational agent prototypes. Since they are prototypes, you will have to say specific phrases
                    for them to understand you. In the future, based on the information we gather from this study, we
                    will create an improved version that will understand nearly any phrase you say to it.

                    Please watch the video below to see how the system works.
                </li>

                <li>
                    The experiment consists of:
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            a <strong>practice stage</strong>,
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            a <strong>novice stage</strong>,
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            and an <strong>advanced stage</strong>, if you identify as an <strong>advanced
                                programmer</strong>.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                <li>For each stage, you will complete three tasks (all very similar tasks) in three different
                    ways:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            through speaking,
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            typing,
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            and speaking/typing (you can choose).
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    The <strong>order</strong> in which you complete them will be <strong>randomized</strong>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    At any point, if you’re absolutely stuck (for example, no progress for 5 minutes), you can
                    type/speak, "I need help", and follow the instructions on-screen.
                </li>
                <li>
                    You will also complete <strong>surveys</strong> about yourself and your experience with the
                    system. We want to improve the system as much as possible, so we appreciate any and all
                    feedback you have!
                </li>

                </li>
                <li>
                    You should expect the experiment to last approximately 30-60 minutes.
                </li>
                <li>
                    You will be able to view <strong>examples/hints on a sidebar on the left side of the
                        screen</strong>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    We are evaluating and comparing <strong>the systems</strong> (voice-based, text-based, and
                    voice/text-based systems), <strong>not your abilities</strong>. Additionally, all results will be
                    anonymized.
                </li>
            </ul>

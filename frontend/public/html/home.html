            <h1>Learning How to Program Conversationally</h1>
        </div>
        <div id="info">
            <h2>Experiment Information</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Natural language</strong> is the regular language we use when we’re talking (as contrasted with computer code). Through this study, we want to see if it’s possible for participants to create a computer program by talking conversationally, in natural language, to a conversational agent. <strong>Conversational agents</strong> are computer programs like chatbots or smart speakers, like Amazon Alexa or Google Home.
                </li>
                <li>
                    In this experiment, you will test <strong>voice-first</strong> and <strong>text-first</strong> conversational agent prototypes. Since they are prototypes, you will have to say specific phrases for them to understand you. In the future, based on the information we gather from this study, we will create an improved version that will understand nearly any phrase you say to it.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The experiment consists of:
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            A <strong>practice stage</strong>, in which you will be guided through a brief programming task with the conversational agent. <strong>Guidance will be shown on the left side of the screen.</strong> You will complete three tasks (all very similar tasks) three different ways: 
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    through speaking, 
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    typing, 
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    and speaking/typing (you can choose whether to speak and/or type).
                                </li>
                            </ul> 
                            The order in which you complete them will be randomized. After each practice stage, you may play around with the system in a “sandbox mode” to see how it works.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            A <strong>novice stage</strong>, in which you will complete a programming task without structured guidance. Hints and examples will be shown on the left side of the screen. If you’re absolutely stuck (for example, no progress in 10 minutes), you can ask the people conducting the experiment for help. You will complete similar tasks three times, interacting with the system through speaking, typing, and speaking/typing (as in the practice mode).
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            If you identify as an <strong>advanced programmer</strong>, there will be an <strong>advanced stage</strong>, in which you complete more difficult programming tasks in the same way you completed the novice tasks.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                        <strong>Surveys</strong>, in which you will answer demographics questions and questions about your experience with the system. We want to improve the system as much as possible, so we appreciate any and all feedback you have!
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>
                    You should expect the experiment to last approximately 30-60 minutes.
                </li>
                <li>
                    You will be able to see your progress at the bottom of the screen on the following pages.
                </li>
                <li>
                    You will be able to view <strong>examples/hints on a sidebar on the left side of the screen</strong>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    We are evaluating and comparing <strong>the systems</strong> (voice-based, text-based, and voice/text-based systems), <strong>not your abilities</strong>. All results will be anonymized.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>How the Experiment Works</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    For each programming system, you will be provided with a goal (for example: "Design a video game character.")
                    You will try to achieve the goal within the constraints of the programming system by speaking or typing natural language.
                </li>
                <li>
                    After you achieve each goal, you will complete a short survey.
                    After you have completed all goals, you will be asked to compare the three systems.
                </li>
            </ul>

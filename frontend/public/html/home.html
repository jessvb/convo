            <h2>Experiment Information</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Natural language is the language we use naturally (as contrasted with an artificial language or computer code).
                    This experiment tests the effectiveness of a natural language, voice-first system, and compares it against a
                    natural language, text-based system and a system with both text and voice programming features.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The experiment consists of 1) a few short surveys, 2) several different goals you need to achieve through the three programming systems
                    (voice only, text only, voice and text).
                </li>
                <li>You should expect the experiment to last approximately 2 hours.</li>
                <li>You will be able to see your progress at the bottom of the screen on the following pages.</li>
                <li>You will be able to view examples/hints on a sidebar on the right side of the screen on the following pages.</li>
                <li>We are evaluating and comparing the different systems, not your abilities. All results are anonymized.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>How the Experiment Works</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    For each programming system, you will be provided a goal or task to achieve (for example: "Design a video game character.")
                    You will try to do so within the constraints of the programming system by speaking  or typing natural language.
                </li>
                <li>
                    After you achieve each goal, you will complete a short survey.
                    After you have completed all goals, you will be asked to compare the three systems.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Survey</h2>

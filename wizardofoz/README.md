# Wizard of Oz
This part of the repository contains the website for the Wizard of Oz user study. Instead of having an actual conversational agent, the agent's responses are controlled by a researcher sending messages over a node server.

## todo
- [ ] Try the system on a server
- [ ] Update list of sentences after you record
- [ ] Create the wizard-of-oz portion of the system (wait for user input (i.e., the "agent's" response) from server)
